This is a sample coded with VanillaJS. I had to rush it because my schedule has been packed and only had this time (midnight) to finish it up. In the future I will implement VUE. 

Functionalities of the page:

To Display knowledge, click on display knowledge button. I decided to do this because I wanted to make the page look as simple as possible. 

To create knowledge, simply key in the name of the knowledge and click on create knowledge. 

To view knowledge document, click on display knowledge, then click on view document. Knowledges without document will show "no document". 

To add document by file, simply choose the file to add, and click on the upload icon. 

To delete knowledge, simply click on the trash icon. 

Thank you for your time.
